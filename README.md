# FFHFlow

## Installation

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the installation is complete you can activate the conda environment by running:
```
conda activate prohmr
```
Install missing packages from pip.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The last step is to install prohmr as a Python package. This will allow you to import it from anywhere in your system.
Since you might want to modify the code, we recommend installing as follows:
```
python setup.py develop
```
